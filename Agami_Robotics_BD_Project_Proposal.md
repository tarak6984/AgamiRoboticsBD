## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

### 1.1 The STEM Education Crisis in Bangladesh

Bangladesh faces a fundamental challenge in STEM education that threatens our competitiveness in the global digital economy. Despite having talented students, three critical barriers prevent access to quality hands-on learning:

#### **Problem #1: Economic Barrier**
- High-quality robotics kits cost ৳8,000-15,000+
- 85% of Bangladeshi families cannot afford these tools
- Schools and colleges lack budget for modern lab equipment
- Import duties and taxes increase costs by 40-60%

#### **Problem #2: Language Barrier**
- All existing robotics kits use English-only documentation
- 70% of students are more comfortable with Bengali instruction
- National curriculum students are particularly excluded
- Technical terminology creates additional comprehension barriers

#### **Problem #3: Infrastructure Gap**
- Limited hands-on STEM facilities in educational institutions
- Theory-heavy curriculum with minimal practical application
- Lack of local technical support and mentorship
- No competition-ready training resources

### 1.2 Market Evidence

**Educational Statistics:**
- 20+ million students in Bangladesh's education system
- Only 3% have access to modern STEM lab facilities
- 0.5% participate in robotics/technology competitions
- 40% of engineering graduates lack practical skills

**Economic Impact:**
- Bangladesh imports ৳200+ crore worth of educational technology annually
- Local STEM innovation participation remains under 1%
- Skills gap in emerging technology sectors continues to widen
